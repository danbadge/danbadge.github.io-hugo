      <title>How we do production release announcements at Driftrock</title>
      <link>https://danbadge.github.io/post/release-notes-at-driftrock/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Driftrock we&amp;rsquo;re a small company that has grown from 8 to 18 people in the last 9 months. That&amp;rsquo;s not excessive but it still challenged some existing methods of communication. One of those was how we communicate new features which have recently gone live, somewhere along the way we stopped doing this.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;shhh-we-re-releasing-software&#34;&gt;Shhh! We&amp;rsquo;re Releasing Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, we deployed a change to one of our applications and didn&amp;rsquo;t tell anyone unless it solved a particular client issue. This meant we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t seek much feedback on new features and the team&amp;rsquo;s progress and activity was largely unseen by the rest of the company. Bearing in mind that our software is increasingly used internally, this seemed like a real missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-release-crab&#34;&gt;Enter Release Crab&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a dedicated Slack channel for internally announcing the release of new features, bug fixes and other changes. The announcement is typically done by a developer after they push their changes to production as they have the most context. But we&amp;rsquo;re pragmatic with it and don&amp;rsquo;t announce every little change, for example, we might wait until we&amp;rsquo;ve finished a sequence of quick deployments. However, &lt;a href=&#34;http://tech.driftrock.com/post/tech-values&#34;&gt;we value feedback&lt;/a&gt; so we&amp;rsquo;re regularly announcing updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a few changes going live for Create (an application for quickly creating ads on Facebook):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://danbadge.github.io/img/release-notes.png&#34; alt=&#34;Example release notes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note the crab emoji - this is now synonymous with release announcements)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a simple and obvious addition to a production deployment but has had surprising impact, here&amp;rsquo;s a few improvements it&amp;rsquo;s made:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tighter feedback loop&lt;/strong&gt; - more communication between the Product Development team (us) and the other teams in Driftrock - Performance Marketing (internal users), Sales and Client Solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased accountability and ownership&lt;/strong&gt; - we could automate these release notes but the personal touch adds an element of accountability, giving the readers a point of contact to field any feedback. Therefore the author needs to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going live and (if necessary) what&amp;rsquo;s happening across the team. Gathering this information is required to help the author distil the announcement into something which is simple and concise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeps deployments small&lt;/strong&gt; - similarly that small amount of manual overhead for the author gives us yet another reason to keep the batch size of a deployment small and ensure we&amp;rsquo;re releasing software early and often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;future-releases&#34;&gt;Future Releases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re still getting used to this process and it will certainly evolve. Early ideas to build on this include automating release notes based on commit messages and working out how we can provide our clients with a similar version, possibly even making these public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update 09/01/2017: Public facing release notes are now available. They are updated every two weeks with the help of our Client Solutions team and you can find them here - &lt;a href=&#34;http://knowledge.driftrock.com/product-updates&#34;&gt;http://knowledge.driftrock.com/product-updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ten deploys a day and still moving slowly</title>

&lt;p&gt;There’s a feeling within my team at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.7digital.com/&#34;&gt;7digital&lt;/a&gt; that we’re taking a long time to complete projects or features. Oddly this isn’t something we are currently measuring. We do though measure the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.robbowley.net/2012/01/06/productivity-throughput-and-cycle-time/&#34;&gt;throughput and cycle time&lt;/a&gt; of tasks. Tasks are items of work which the team create as a small iterative step towards a larger feature or story. This is useful for visualising the teams productivity, with the idealistic target of low cycle time and high throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically our stakeholders are interested in an estimation and delivery of a project or feature not a task. I was interested to see whether this was something we could measure, with a slant towards having historical data available for helping us estimate. I gathered all the tasks into a spreadsheet going back to the beginning of September 2012 and assigned a descriptive project and feature name I hoped the rest of the organisation could understand. This had the added benefit of forcing me to step back from the implementation and attempt to relate technical items to organisation priorities, something which is far too often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This produced some interesting results, which aligned with the team’s fears. Our average lead time of the six planned projects we had completed since September was 160 days. Over half a year! Moreover, this only represents the time it takes for an organisation-wide project to pass-through our team, often there are several teams involved each with their own changes and features to implement. We do roughly two features per project and so it’s a similar story there. On average we’re taking 72 days to complete a feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have our &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DeploymentPipeline.html&#34;&gt;deployment pipeline&lt;/a&gt; at 7digital and deploying changes to production is an absolute breeze. In fact, we’re so good at it we can’t stop talking about it &lt;a href=&#34;http://prezi.com/2wczo541qzpy/dddea-continuous-delivery-at-7digital/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.7digital.com/dev/2012/06/20/evolution-of-deployment-in-7digital/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.7digital.com/dev/2012/04/28/how-we-do-deployments/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. So what’s taking us so long to get new features out the door?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;technical-debt&#34;&gt;Technical Debt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a lot of technical debt. It’s not tested, it’s horribly coupled and entirely confusing, a proper &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud&#34;&gt;ball of mud&lt;/a&gt;. We try not too but occasionally we touch it and it can slow development down. We’ve been bitten before too where a change we made broke something unrelated in production. We can roll back with ease though so it’s not all that scary and can’t be entirely accountable for our tame pace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bottlenecks&#34;&gt;Bottlenecks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing public-facing APIs with numerous existing clients all with their own priorities and ageing implementations presents a challenge in patience and communication. Fortunately, we’ve already made some progress here: In a recent project we needed to migrate a few external API consumers to a new endpoint. We did all the work, communicated the changes and waited. Several months later we started to see some usage only to find out our endpoint wasn’t quite working as expected. To try and mitigate that we have a new policy within our team, dogfooding. We’re now attempting to consume any of our new endpoints we can. There’s two big benefits here: code running in production and failing early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unplanned-projects&#34;&gt;Unplanned Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst looking back through the data and trying to determine project names, relationships began to emerge between occasional tasks. We found examples of sizeable unplanned projects, not just unplanned tasks, bubbling away in the background. These projects did have clear value and even related back to wider organisational priorities. As a team though we had already committed to other supposedly more important already in-progress projects. Crucially, this results in extended delivery dates on all the projects being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;distractions-in-parallel&#34;&gt;Distractions in Parallel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done the maths and six projects at 160 days each in under a year doesn’t add up. We’ve toyed with a number setups but generally we have two streams and therefore two projects or two features on the go at any one time with a pair on each thing (there’s four of us). This means our focus is constantly shifting between those two items whilst we attempt to give them equal attention. Looking at this further, I attempted to determine the amount of days we spent not working on an ‘in-progress’ feature and in every example it dwarfs the amount of days spent working on the feature. Clearly by spreading ourselves across two things we’re generating much more waste then we realise and unlike technical debt and bottlenecks this is one area where we have much more control.&lt;/p&gt;
